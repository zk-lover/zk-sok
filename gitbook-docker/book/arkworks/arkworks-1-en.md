# 1. Struct Definition: CubicPlusLinearCircuit
- Defines a circuit that computes the output `y` from the input variable `x` using a constraint system.

# 2. generate_constraints
- The struct defined above must implement this method.
- **Input**:  
  `cs`: A reference type `ConstraintSystemRef`, representing a reference to the constraint system used for registering variables and constraints.
- **Output**:  
  - `Ok(())`: Indicates constraints were successfully generated.  
  - `Err(SynthesisError)`: Indicates an error occurred during the constraint generation process.

# 3. cs.new_witness_variable
- **Functionality**: Defines a witness variable in the constraint system, representing a secret input value provided by the prover.
- **Input**:  
  A closure defining the logic to return the variable. For example:  
  `|| self.x.ok_or(SynthesisError::AssignmentMissing)`  
  If `self.x` has a value, it returns `x`; otherwise, it returns the error `SynthesisError::AssignmentMissing`, indicating the variable was not assigned.
- **Output**:  
  Returns an identifier for the newly defined witness variable `x`, which is registered in the constraint system for subsequent use in constraints.

# 4. cs.new_input_variable
- **Functionality**: Defines a public input variable in the constraint system, representing a public input value for the circuit. Public input variables are exposed to the verifier, who can directly check if the value satisfies the constraints.
- **Input**:  
  Same as `cs.new_witness_variable`, a closure defining the variable logic.
- **Output**:  
  Returns an identifier for the newly defined public input variable `y`. The value of `y` can be directly provided by the verifier to validate the proof.

# 5. lc!()
- **Functionality**: A macro used to create linear combinations in the constraint system.  
  Example: `lc!() + (2, x) + (3, y)` represents the linear combination `2x + 3y`.

# 6. cs.enforce_constraint
- **Functionality**: Adds a constraint to the constraint system, defining the product of two linear combinations as equal to another linear combination.
- **Input**:  
  Three linear combinations `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the equation `a * b = c`.
- **Output**:  
  - `Ok(())`: Indicates the constraint was successfully added.  
  - `Err(SynthesisError)`: Indicates an error occurred while adding the constraint.
