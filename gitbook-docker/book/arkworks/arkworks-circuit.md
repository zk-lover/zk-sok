# `Arkworks` Circuit Documentation
`arkworks` provides a flexible and modular framework for building zero-knowledge proof circuits. It allows developers to construct circuits by defining constraints directly using its rich set of libraries, such as `ark-relations` for constraint systems and `ark-crypto-primitives` for cryptographic components.  

Developers can create custom circuits by leveraging the `ConstraintSynthesizer` trait, which requires the implementation of the `generate_constraints` method. Within this method, developers describe the relationships and constraints among variables, and `arkworks` takes care of compiling these constraints into a rank-1 constraint system (R1CS). This design enables developers to efficiently define and customize circuits.

## 1. ConstraintSynthesizer

### Purpose:
- Defines the interface for generating circuit constraints, serving as the core abstraction for implementing circuit logic.

### Composition:
- A generic `ConstraintF`, representing the finite field type used in the constraint system.

### Related Methods:
#### 1.1 generate_constraints
```
fn generate_constraints(self, cs: ConstraintSystemRef<F>) -> crate::r1cs::Result<()>;
```
- **Input:**
  - `cs: ConstraintSystemRef<ConstraintF>`: Reference to the constraint system.
- **Output:**
  - `Result<(), SynthesisError>`: Indicates whether constraint generation was successful.
- **Purpose:**
  - Defines the variables and their constraints in the circuit.
  - Constructs the circuit by calling methods of the constraint system (e.g., `new_input_variable`, `enforce_constraint`).

#### Example:
```rust
impl<ConstraintF: Field> ConstraintSynthesizer<ConstraintF> for MyCircuit<ConstraintF> {
    fn generate_constraints(
        self,
        cs: ConstraintSystemRef<ConstraintF>,
    ) -> Result<(), SynthesisError> {
        // Define circuit constraints here
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## 2. ConstraintSystemRef

### Purpose:
- Represents a mutable reference to the constraint system, used for dynamically constructing circuit constraints.

### Composition:
- Contains variables and linear combinations of the R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System).

### Related Methods:
#### 2.1. new_input_variable
```
pub fn new_input_variable<Func>(&self, f: Func) -> crate::r1cs::Result<Variable>
```
- **Input:**
  - A closure that returns the specific value of the public input.
- **Output:**
  - `Result<Variable, SynthesisError>`: The newly created input variable.
- **Purpose:**
  - Defines the public input variables of the circuit.

#### 2.2. new_witness_variable
```
pub fn new_witness_variable<Func>(&self, f: Func) -> crate::r1cs::Result<Variable>
```
- **Input:**
  - A closure that returns the specific value of the witness variable.
- **Output:**
  - `Result<Variable, SynthesisError>`: The newly created witness variable.
- **Purpose:**
  - Defines the witness variables in the circuit (used only by the prover).

#### 2.3. enforce_constraint
```
pub fn enforce_constraint(
        &self,
        a: LinearCombination<F>,
        b: LinearCombination<F>,
        c: LinearCombination<F>,
    ) -> crate::r1cs::Result<()>
```
- **Input:**
  - Three linear combinations: `lc_a`, `lc_b`, `lc_c`, corresponding to the constraint `A * B = C`.
- **Output:**
  - `Result<(), SynthesisError>`: Indicates whether the constraint was successfully added.
- **Purpose:**
  - Adds a multiplication constraint ensuring `A * B = C`.

#### 2.4. num_constraints
```
 pub fn num_constraints(&self) -> usize
```
- **Input:** None.
- **Output:**
  - `usize`: The number of constraints currently in the system.
- **Purpose:**
  - Retrieves the total number of constraints added to the circuit, useful for debugging or optimization.

#### Example:
```rust
let x = cs.new_witness_variable(|| Ok(Scalar::from(3u32)))?;
let y = cs.new_witness_variable(|| Ok(Scalar::from(4u32)))?;
let z = cs.new_input_variable(|| Ok(Scalar::from(12u32)))?;
cs.enforce_constraint(lc!() + x, lc!() + y, lc!() + z)?;
```

## 3. Variable

### Purpose:
- Represents a variable in the R1CS system, which can be part of inputs, witnesses, or linear combinations.

### Composition:
- Variable type and index (e.g., input, witness, or constant).

## 4. LinearCombination (created via the macro `lc!`)

### Purpose:
- Represents a linear combination of a set of variables, used to construct constraints.

### Composition:
- A linear combination of several variables and their coefficients.

### Related Macro:
#### 4.1. lc!
- Simplifies the creation of linear combinations.

#### Example:
```rust
let lc_a = lc!() + (Scalar::from(2u32), x) + (Scalar::from(3u32), y);
```
