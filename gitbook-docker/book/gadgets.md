# Gadgets

In this chapter, we will explore the prepackaged components—commonly referred to as gadgets—offered by various zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) libraries, along with their associated APIs.

Gadgets are reusable, high-level building blocks that abstract complex cryptographic and arithmetic operations, such as field element multiplications, hash functions, Merkle tree operations, and range proofs. These components significantly simplify the development process by allowing developers to focus on constructing circuits without needing to delve into low-level implementation details.

We will examine the design, functionality, and usability of these gadgets, highlighting their role in accelerating the development of ZKP-based applications. Furthermore, we will analyze the APIs provided to interact with these gadgets, showcasing how they enable developers to seamlessly integrate them into custom circuit designs. Through practical examples and comparisons, we aim to provide a clear understanding of how these prepackaged components can enhance productivity and ensure the correctness of ZKP implementations.
