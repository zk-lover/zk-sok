# `Spartan` Circuit Documentation

Spartan introduces an innovative approach to zero-knowledge proofs by eliminating the need for trusted setups and offering succinct proofs with minimal cryptographic assumptions. Its unique use of polynomial commitments and efficient encoding of constraint systems allows for faster proof generation and verification. Spartanâ€™s lightweight design makes it suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its support for non-interactive proofs provides strong guarantees of privacy and correctness. This combination of efficiency and simplicity positions Spartan as a powerful tool for building privacy-preserving systems in real-world applications.

In this section, we will introduce the circuit building APIs of Spartan, including Instance, VarsAssignment, and InputsAssignment.

## 1.Instance

**Purpose:** Represents an R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) instance, including constraint matrices and system parameters.

**Components:**
- Number of constraints (`num_constraints`)
- Number of variables (`num_variables`)
- Number of inputs (`num_inputs`)
- Matrices `A`, `B`, `C`

**Related Functions:**

1. **new**
   ```
   pub fn new(
    num_cons: usize,
    num_vars: usize,
    num_inputs: usize,
    A: &[(usize, usize, [u8; 32])],
    B: &[(usize, usize, [u8; 32])],
    C: &[(usize, usize, [u8; 32])],
    ) -> Result<Instance, R1CSError>
   ```
   - **Input:**
     - `num_constraints`: Number of constraints
     - `num_variables`: Number of variables
     - `num_inputs`: Number of inputs
     - `A`, `B`, `C`: Sparse matrices
   - **Output:**`Instance`: Newly created R1CS instance.
   - **Purpose:** Creates a new R1CS instance for generating and verifying proofs.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```rust
     let instance = Instance::new(num_cons, num_vars, num_inputs, &A, &B, &C).unwrap();
     ```

2. **is_sat**
   ```
   pub fn is_sat(&self, vars: &VarsAssignment, inputs: &InputsAssignment) -> Result<bool, Error>
   ```
   - **Input:**
     - `vars`: Variable assignment (`VarsAssignment`)
     - `inputs`: Input assignment (`InputsAssignment`)
   - **Output:**`Result<bool, Error>`: Indicates whether the instance is satisfiable.
   - **Purpose:** Checks if the given variables and inputs satisfy the R1CS constraints.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```rust
     let is_satisfied = instance.is_sat(&vars_assignment, &inputs_assignment).unwrap();
     ```

## 2.VarsAssignment

**Purpose:** Represents the specific assignment of variables in an R1CS instance.

**Components:**
- Byte array of variables.

**Related Functions:**

1. **new**
   ```
   pub fn new(assignment: &[[u8; 32]]) -> Result<Assignment, R1CSError>
   ```

   - **Input:**`vars`: Byte array of variables.
   - **Output:**`VarsAssignment`: New variable assignment instance.
   - **Purpose:** Creates a variable assignment instance for verifying the satisfiability of the R1CS.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```rust
     let vars_assignment = VarsAssignment::new(&vars).unwrap();
     ```

## 3.InputsAssignment

**Purpose:** Represents the specific assignment of public inputs in an R1CS instance.

**Components:**
- Byte array of inputs.

**Related Functions:**

1. **new**
   ```
   pub fn new(assignment: &[[u8; 32]]) -> Result<Assignment, R1CSError>
   ```

   - **Input:**`inputs`: Byte array of inputs.
   - **Output:**`InputsAssignment`: New input assignment instance.
   - **Purpose:** Creates a public input assignment instance for verifying the satisfiability of the R1CS.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```rust
     let inputs_assignment = InputsAssignment::new(&inputs).unwrap();
     ```
