# Proving Systems
In this chapter, we will introduce the APIs of backend proving systems in various zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) libraries.

We will explore how these APIs are structured to facilitate the integration and utilization of backend proving systems, focusing on their key functionalities, such as proof generation, proof verification, and the configuration of cryptographic parameters. By examining the design and usability of these APIs, we aim to highlight the level of abstraction they offer to developers, making complex cryptographic operations more accessible.
