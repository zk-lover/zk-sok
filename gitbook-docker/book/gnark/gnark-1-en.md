## 1. Constraints and Circuit Construction

### 1.1 `frontend.API` (Circuit Definition and Operations)

`frontend.API` is an interface used to define circuit constraints. It provides various operations (such as addition, multiplication, constants, variables, etc.) to express relationships between variables in the circuit.

#### Common Methods:

- **`api.Add(a, b frontend.Variable) frontend.Variable`**
  - **Input**: `a` and `b` are variables or constants in the circuit (`frontend.Variable`).
  - **Output**: Returns the result of `a + b`.
  - **Function**: Implements the addition operation.

- **`api.Mul(a, b frontend.Variable) frontend.Variable`**
  - **Input**: `a` and `b` are variables or constants in the circuit (`frontend.Variable`).
  - **Output**: Returns the result of `a * b`.
  - **Function**: Implements the multiplication operation.

- **`api.Constant(c int64) frontend.Variable`**
  - **Input**: `c` is an integer constant.
  - **Output**: Returns the constant `c` as a `frontend.Variable`.
  - **Function**: Used to generate constants in the circuit.

- **`api.AssertIsEqual(a, b frontend.Variable)`**
  - **Input**: `a` and `b` are variables in the circuit.
  - **Output**: No return value (throws an error if the constraint is not satisfied).
  - **Function**: Enforces that `a` and `b` are equal, used to create constraints.

### 1.2 `frontend.Compile` (Circuit Compilation)

#### Function:
`frontend.Compile` compiles the circuit structure into an R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) representation, which is the core of zero-knowledge proof protocols. R1CS is a standardized format used to describe circuit constraints, and zero-knowledge proof systems use it to verify relationships within the circuit.

#### Input:
- **curve**: The curve used (e.g., `curve.BN254`). `gnark` supports different elliptic curves, and you can choose the one that fits your needs.
- **Circuit definition**: The circuit structure containing the constraints. Typically, this is a struct that implements the `frontend.Circuit` interface. This struct defines the relationships and constraints between variables in the circuit.

#### Output:
- **R1CS**: The compiled circuit representation. `R1CS` is the circuit representation used in zero-knowledge proofs, and it defines all the linear constraints in the circuit.

#### Usage:
When calling the `frontend.Compile` method, you need to provide two parameters:

1. **curve**: Specifies the curve to be used (e.g., `curve.BN254`).
2. **Circuit definition**: A struct that implements the `frontend.Circuit` interface.
