# `gnark` ZKP Documentation

In this section, we introduce the relevant APIs of gnark's proof system, including Setup, Prove, and Verify.

## 1 `backend.Setup` (Proof System Setup)

**Purpose:**

`backend.Setup` is used to generate the proving key and verifying key based on the R1CS circuit. This is the initialization phase of the zero-knowledge proof protocol. After the circuit is defined and compiled into R1CS, you need to call this method to prepare the keys required for proving and verification.

**Input:**

- **R1CS**: The R1CS circuit representation generated by `frontend.Compile`. R1CS is a standardized format containing the circuit constraints.

**Output:**

- **provingKey**: The key used to generate the proof.
- **verifyingKey**: The key used to verify the proof.

**Usage:**

When calling the `backend.Setup` method, you need to provide the compiled R1CS circuit. It will return two keys: one for generating the proof (`provingKey`) and the other for verifying the proof (`verifyingKey`).

## 2 `backend.Prove` (Generate Proof)

**Purpose:**

`backend.Prove` is used to generate a zero-knowledge proof based on the proving key. By providing the circuit, private input, and proving key, you can generate a proof that demonstrates a statement is correct for a given circuit and private input.

**Input:**

- **provingKey**: The key used to generate the proof. This is generated by the `backend.Setup` method.
- **circuit**: The circuit structure containing the constraints. You need to provide a struct that implements the `frontend.Circuit` interface.
- **privateInput**: The private input, which includes the secret data in the circuit. Typically, this is the part of the proof that you want to keep hidden.

**Output:**

- **proof**: The generated zero-knowledge proof.

**Usage:**

When calling the `backend.Prove` method, you need to provide the proving key, the defined circuit, and the associated private input. It will return a proof object that demonstrates the circuit and private input satisfy the constraints.

## 3 `backend.Verify` (Verify Proof)

**Purpose:**

`backend.Verify` is used to verify the validity of a zero-knowledge proof. By providing the verifying key, public input, and the proof object, it ensures that a statement is correct for the given circuit and public input.

**Input:**

- **verifyingKey**: The key used to verify the proof. This is generated by the `backend.Setup` method.
- **publicInput**: The public input, which is the public part of the zero-knowledge proof. This is typically the input data for the circuit and does not include the secret (private) part.
- **proof**: The zero-knowledge proof to verify.

**Output:**

- **valid**: A boolean value indicating whether the proof is valid. Returns `true` if valid; otherwise, returns `false`.
- **error**: Error message (if any).

**Usage:**

When calling the `backend.Verify` method, you need to provide the verifying key, the public input, and the proof to verify. It will return a boolean value indicating whether the proof is valid.
