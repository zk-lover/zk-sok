## Range Proof

This code uses the Plonky2 library to prove that a given value lies within a specified range. It first sets up the circuit configuration and creates a circuit builder, adding a virtual target as the secret value. This value is registered as a public input for later printing. The code performs a range check on the value using the `range_check` method and outputs the number of gates in the circuit. It then sets a partial witness value, constructs the circuit data, and generates a proof. The generated proof is converted to a byte array, and its size is printed. Finally, the code verifies the proof and outputs the time taken to generate and verify the proof.

Below, we will divide the code into code blocks and annotate them.

### 1. Imports from plonky2

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use plonky2::field::types::Field;
use plonky2::iop::witness::{PartialWitness, WitnessWrite};
use plonky2::plonk::circuit_builder::CircuitBuilder;
use plonky2::plonk::circuit_data::CircuitConfig;
use plonky2::plonk::config::{GenericConfig, PoseidonGoldilocksConfig};
use std::time::Instant;
```

* Import necessary modules and traits. `anyhow::Result` is used for error handling. `plonky2` modules are used for building and working with zero-knowledge proofs.

### 2. Circuit Construction

##### Constants and Type Aliases

```rust
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    const D: usize = 2;
    type C = PoseidonGoldilocksConfig;
    type F = <C as GenericConfig<D>>::F;
```

* `D` is a constant representing the degree of the polynomial.

* `C` is a type alias for the configuration used in the circuit.

* `F` is a type alias for the field type derived from the configuration.

##### Circuit Configuration

```rust
    let config = CircuitConfig::standard_recursion_zk_config();
    let mut builder = CircuitBuilder::<F, D>::new(config);
```

* `config` is created using a standard zero-knowledge configuration.

* `builder` is an instance of `CircuitBuilder` initialized with the configuration, used to construct the circuit.

##### Virtual Target and Public Input

```rust
    let value = builder.add_virtual_target();
    builder.register_public_input(value);
```

* `value` is a virtual target added to the circuit, representing the secret value.

* `value` is registered as a public input, allowing it to be printed later.

##### Range Check

```rust
    let log_max = 32;
    println!("Gates before range check: {}", builder.num_gates());
    builder.range_check(value, log_max);
    println!("Gates after range check: {}", builder.num_gates());
    println!("Number of gates before building: {}", builder.num_gates());
    println!("Number of public inputs: {}", builder.num_public_inputs());
```

* `log_max` is set to 32, representing the maximum range for the value.

* The number of gates before and after the range check is printed for debugging.

* Prints the number of gates and public inputs before building the circuit.

### 3. ZK Proof Generation and Verification

##### Partial Witness

```rust
    let mut pw = PartialWitness::new();
    let _ = pw.set_target(value, F::from_canonical_usize(10086));
```

* `pw` is a `PartialWitness` object used to set the value of the virtual target.

* The target is set to `10086` using `from_canonical_usize`.

##### Proof Construction

```rust
    println!("Constructing inner proof with {} gates", builder.num_gates());
    let start1 = Instant::now();
    let data = builder.build::<C>();
    let proof = data.prove(pw)?;
    let start2 = Instant::now();
```

* Prints the number of gates used in the proof.

* `start1` records the time before building the circuit.

* `data` is the built circuit data.

* `proof` is generated using the `prove` method.

* `start2` records the time after proof generation.

##### Proof Serialization

```rust
    let proof_bytes = proof.to_bytes();
    let size = proof_bytes.len();
    println!("Size of proof_bytes: {}", size);
```

* Converts the proof to a byte array and prints its size.

##### Proof Verification

```rust
    println!("Value {} is less than 2^{}", proof.public_inputs[0], log_max);
    data.verify(proof);
    let start3 = Instant::now();
```

* Prints the public input value and verifies the proof.

* `start3` records the time after verification.

##### Timing and Completion

```rust
    let duration1 = start2.duration_since(start1);
    let duration2 = start3.duration_since(start2);
    let millis1 = duration1.as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;
    let millis2 = duration2.as_secs_f64() * 1000.0;
    println!("Prove time: {:.3} milliseconds", millis1);
    println!("Verify time: {:.3} milliseconds", millis2);
    Ok(())
}
```

* Calculates and prints the time taken for proof generation and verification in milliseconds.

* Returns `Ok(())` to indicate successful execution.
