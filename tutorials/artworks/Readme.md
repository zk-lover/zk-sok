### Sample programs using the artworks library

We have implemented the three example programs mentioned in our paper based on the artworks library, including:

* A Cubic Expression

* Range Proof

* Hash Function(SHA256)

The program source code can be found under

> arkworkslab/src/

This tutorial will provide an introduction to our example program codes to demonstrate the use of arkworks.
